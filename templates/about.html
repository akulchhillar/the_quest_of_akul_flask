<p>
    Hi there, I am Akul Chhillar.
    I am a self-taught programmer who likes to build stuff that not only solves problems but also helps
    me grow. I enjoy understanding how things work.
  </p>
  <p>I am currently working at Gartner as a VBA Developer where I work on projects related to excel automation.</p>
  <p>This is one of my side projects where I blog about stuff that creates curiousity in my mind and the topics range from economincs to productivity to technology.</p>

  <p>And since I am not a professional blogger I may not be consistent with it thus I would highly recommend you to sign up below to make sure that you get notified the next time I post.</p>
